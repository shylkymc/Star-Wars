# Star-Wars

In this project, I used a survey data set. This data set obtained by [FiveThirthyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).
I made exploratory analyses and visualized the rankings of viewed series of Star Wars and rates according to genders. I used pandas and matplotlib libraries.
